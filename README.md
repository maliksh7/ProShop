## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database for storing product and user information
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests
- React: Frontend library for building the user interface
- Node.js: Server-side runtime for running the backend
- Concurrently: Allows running both frontend and backend servers with a single command

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/proshop.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash

    ```
3. **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**

   ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```
4. **Create a .env file in the backend folder and add necessary environment variables (database connection, JWT secret, etc.).**

5. **Run the application using concurrently:**

   ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
